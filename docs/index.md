# Risk Data Library Standard

The **Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS)** is an open data standard to make it easier to work with disaster and climate risk data. It provides a common description of the data used and produced in risk assessments, including **hazard**, **exposure**, **vulnerability**, and **modelled loss or impact**, data.

The Risk Data Library (RDL) project grew out of in-depth community consultation on improving access to **risk information** and is a result of the collective effort and ongoing support of internationally-recognised research institutions and established global partnerships with combined expertise across multiple hazards and all aspects of risk assessment. Its overarching purpose is to support disaster resilience work by making risk data better and easier to work with.

The RDLS gives risk experts a single language to describe hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets. It gives datasets an underlying consistency that makes them highly interoperable and easily read by both people and machines. The schema contains labels for key metadata fields, making it easier to identify datasets hosted in different online catalogs without relying on external files or descriptions.

The RDLS has been developed by World Bank GFDRR for disaster and climate risk assessments but is intended to be used by anyone involved in generating or using disaster risk information.

This documentation provides a technical overview of the RDLS and its different elements:

- [Overview](rdl/index.md): The core standards used within the RDLS, use cases and a roadmap
- [Data model](data_model/index.md): how to organize and link the data using the RDLS schema
- [Taxonomy](taxonomies/index.md): details of taxonomies adopted by the RDLS
- [Guides](guides/index.md): how to implement the RDLS in your project
- [About](about/index.md): other information on the roadmap, history, governance and license

The RDL is a collaborative project managed by the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)](https://www.gfdrr.org/) of the World Bank Group.
