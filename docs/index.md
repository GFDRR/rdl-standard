# Risk Data Library Standard

The **Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS)** is an open data standard to make it easier to work with disaster and climate risk data. It provides a common description of the data used and produced in risk assessments, including **hazard**, **exposure**, **vulnerability**, and **modelled loss**, or impact, data.

The RDLS provides a unique way to create, store, exchange and use disaster different risk information together. It is at the core of the Risk Data Library, a suite of open source tools to work with disaster and climate risk data.

The RDLS has been developed by World Bank GFDRR for disaster and climate risk assessments but is intended to be used by anyone involved in generating or using disaster risk information.

This documentation provides a technical overview of the RDLS and its different elements:

- [**Core standards**](standards.md): description of existing open data standards used in the RDLS
- [**Taxonomy**](taxonomies/index.md): details of taxonomies adopted by the RDLS
- [**Data model**](data_model/index.md): how to organize and link the data using the RDLS schema
- [**Implementation**](implementation/index.md): how to apply the RDLS in your project
- [**Tutorials**](tutorials/index.md): how to adopte and use RDLS for different pruposes
- [**About**](about/index.md): other information on the roadmap, history, governance and license

<br/>

The RDL is a collaborative project managed by the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)](https://www.gfdrr.org/) of the World Bank Group.
