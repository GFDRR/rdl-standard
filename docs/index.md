# Risk Data Library Standard

The **Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS) is an open metadata standard** to describe datasets used in climate and disaster risk assessments. 

The overarching purpose of RDLS is to support climate and disaster risk reduction and resilience building by making risk data better and easier to work with.

The RDLS is designed to make it easier to work with disaster and climate risk data by providing a common description of **hazard**, **exposure**, **vulnerability**, and **modelled loss or impact** data.

The standard originated from an in-depth consultation with the disaster and climate risk modeling community on improving access to **risk information**. It is the result of collective effort and ongoing support of internationally-recognised research institutions and established global partnerships with combined expertise across multiple hazards and all aspects of risk assessment. 

The RDLS gives risk experts a single language to describe the contents of risk datasets, providing the consistency that makes them highly interoperable, easily read by both people and machines and easier to identify datasets hosted in different online catalogs.

The RDLS is curated by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and is intended for use by anyone involved in generating or using disaster risk information, and is open to community contributions to improve the standard.

This documentation provides a technical overview of the RDLS including the data model and taxonomies used in the RDLS:

- [Overview](rdl/index.md): The core standards used within the RDLS, use cases and a roadmap
- [Data model](data_model/index.md): how to organize and link the data using the RDLS schema
- [Taxonomy](taxonomies/index.md): details of taxonomies adopted by the RDLS


The documentation also provides guidance on how to implement the RDLS for your own datasets or data catalog, including creating JSON metadata files, packaging data and recommended formats for risk data:

- [Guides](guides/index.md): how to implement the RDLS in your project
- [About](about/index.md): other information on the roadmap, history, governance and license

The RDL is a collaborative project managed by the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)](https://www.gfdrr.org/) of the World Bank Group.
