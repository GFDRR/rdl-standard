# RDL metadata

## Adoption of the metadata schema
Metadata enables datasets to be found by human and machine searches, and so users can easily identify the dataset contents. It is strongly encouraged that any risk dataset being uploaded online has metadata prepared and uploaded with it.
 
The Risk Data Library Standard defines metadata in JSON format, but it can be translated into table (csv/excel). `WIP`

- Option 1. Write directly into JSON file (templates are available at ...)
- Option 2. Use JSON metadata creation tool. This tool is standalone (not part of DDH) AND UNDER DEVELOPMENT. It uses an xsl file containing metadata in a specified structure, and exports a JSON file to be saved with the dataset.
