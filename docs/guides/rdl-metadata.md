# RDL metadata

## Adoption of the metadata schema
Metadata should be created for each dataset so it can be found by human and machine searches, and so users can easily identify the dataset contents.
 
The Risk Data Library Standard defines metadata in JSON format, but it can be translated into table (csv/excel). `WIP`

- Option 1. Write directly into JSON file (templates are available at ...)
- Option 2. Use JSON metadata creation tool. This tool is standalone (not part of DDH) AND UNDER DEVELOPMENT. It uses an xsl file containing metadata in a specified structure, and exports a JSON file to be saved with the dataset.
