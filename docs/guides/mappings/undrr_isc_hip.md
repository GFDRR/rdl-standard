The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and International Science Council (UNDRR-ISC) [Hazard Information Profiles](https://www.undrr.org/publication/hazard-information-profiles-hips) provides a common set of hazard definitions for monitoring and reviewing implementation of the Sendai Framework, Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

The following table provides a mapping between the UNDRR-ISC Hazard Information Profiles and the RDLS [hazard_type](../../reference/codelists.md#hazard_type) and [process type](../../reference/codelists.md#process_type) codelists. You can also [download the mapping as a CSV file](../../../mappings/undrr-isc-hip.csv).
