# Reference

```{note}
   Throughout the reference documentation, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
```

The [schema reference](schema.md) is the canonical reference for the structure of the Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS) data model, the meaning of each field, and the rules that must be followed to publish RDLS data. You can also [view the schema in an interactive browser](browser.md).

The [codelist reference](codelists.md) is the canonical reference for the meaning of the codes used to limit and standardise the possible values of fields in RDLS data.
