# Metadata reference

```{note}
   Throughout the reference documentation, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
```

This section specifies the structure and format of Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS) metadata.

The [schema reference](schema.md) is the canonical reference for the structure of RDLS metadata, the meaning of each field, and the rules that must be followed to publish RDLS metadata. You can also [view the schema in an interactive browser](browser.md).

The [codelist reference](codelists.md) is the canonical reference for the meaning of the codes used to limit and standardise the possible values of fields in RDLS metadata.
