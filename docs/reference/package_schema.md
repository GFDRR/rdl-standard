# Package schema

The package schema describes the structure of the container for publishing RDLS metadata.

For this version of RDLS, the canonical URL of the package schema is [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GFDRR/rdl-standard/0__2__0/schema/rdls_package_schema.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GFDRR/rdl-standard/0__2__0/schema/rdls_package_schema.json). Use the canonical URL to make sure that your software, documentation or other resources refer to the specific version of the schema with which they were tested.

This page presents the package schema in an interactive browser. Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section. Required fields are indicated in **bold**.
