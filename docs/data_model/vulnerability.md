# Vulnerability

## Schema attributes

The vulnerability schema includes physical fragility and vulnerability relationships in relation to specific hazards or for multi-hazard (combination of individual hazards). A wide range of model types and parameters can describe vulnerability, for this reason there are many possible variables accounted by the Vulnerability schema. But only a part of them will be required to describe one specific model.
The schema distinguishes key information describing the vulnerabilirt model, including:

- function type (i.e fragility, vulnerability, damage-to-loss)
- countries the function was developed for, measured in terms of to geographic relevance
- development approach (empirical, analytical, judgement, hybrid, code-based)
- mathematical model used (including exponential, cumulative lognormal/normal)
- the intensity measure and asset type the function relates to
- loss parameter / engineering demand parameter values

The **model** attributes specify which hazard types and exposure categories the vulnerability relationship applies to.
Other attributes describe the function type and the analytical approach adopted, and add notes on the model applicability in terms of location and scale.
