# GED4all exposure taxonomy

We encourage the use of GED4all taxonomy, described in full [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GED4ALL).<br>
In order to summarise all the asset information into a single alphanumeric string, a tool will be provided, similar to the ['taxtweb'](https://platform.openquake.org/taxtweb/) tool available from GEM dedicated to _buildings_ taxonomy.

The taxonomy covers four main categories:

- [Buildings](#buildings)
- [Lifelines](#lifelines)
- [Crops, Livestock and Forestry](#crops-livestock-and-forestry)
- [Socio-Economic indicators](#socio-economic-indicators)

## Buildings
The buildings taxonomy is based on GEM openquake taxonomy, with some semplifications. The taxonomy string is built as sequence of attributes separeted by slash:

`MATERIAL/HEIGHT/DATE/OCCUPANCY/SHAPE/â€¦`

Missing attributes can be skipped from the string, e.g.

2-floors detached residential dwelling, reinforced concrete structure: `CR/H:2/RES1`

## Lifelines
The **lifelines** taxonomy includes all infrastructures commonly found in populated areas, such as:

- [Roads and railways](#roads-and-railways)
- [Pipelines](#pipelines)
- [Energy generation and power grid](#energy-generation-and-power-grid)
- [Potable water and wastewater system](#potable-water-and-wastewater-systems)
- [Communication systems](#communication-systems)

Three main sources of information have been used for the definition of this taxonomy: FP7 EU Project [Syner-G](http://www.vce.at/SYNER-G), HAZUS11 recommendations, and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) classification system.

### Roads and railways

This taxonomy is strongly based on the classification system adopted by OpenStreetMap, since OSM is undoubtedly the largest and most complete source of open information concerning the location of roads and railways.
The taxonomy string is simply `TYPE+CATEGORY`, e.g.

Secondary road: `RDN+SE`

<div class="scrollbar table-scroll" markdown="1">
| Attribute | Code | Description |
|-|:-:|-|
| Road   network | RDN+MO | Motorway: restricted access major divided highway (i.e. freeway), normally with 2 or   more running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder |
|  | RDN+TR | Trunk:   the most important roads in a country's system that aren't motorways (not necessarily be a divided highway) |
|  | RDN+PR | Primary:   the next most important roads in a country's system (often link larger towns) |
|  | RDN+SE | Secondary:   the next most important roads in a country's system (often link towns) |
|  | RDN+TE | Tertiary:   the next most important roads in a country's system (often link smaller towns and villages) |
|  | RDN+UN | Unclassified:   the least  important through roads in a country's system (often link villages and hamlets) |
|  | RDN+RE | Residential:   roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing. |
|  | RDN+SR | Service:   access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. |
|  | RDN | Unknown:   no  information concerning road typology |
| Railway network | RLW+LR | Light rail: a higher-standard tram system, normally in its own right-of-way. Often reaches a considerable length (tens of kilometer) |
|  | RLW+MR | Monorail:   a single-rail railway |
|  | RLW+RL | Rail:   full sized passenger or freight trains in the standard gauge for the country or state |
|  | RLW+SW | Subway:   a city passenger underground rail service running mostly grade separated |
|  | RLW+TR | Tram:   one or two carriage rail vehicles, usually sharing motor road. |
|  | RLW | Unknown:   no additional information concerning rail typology. |

### Pipelines

The taxonomy presented herein has been developed using the classification experience developed in Syner-G and STREST (Crowley et al., 2016).
The taxonomy string is simply `PPL/CONTENT/POSITION/MATERIAL/JOINT_TYPE/SOIL_TYPE/DIAMETER`, e.g.

Large elevated pipe for potable water: `CPW/PEL/DLG`

### Energy generation and power grid

We follow the taxonomy adopted by HAZUS, which allows capturing the capacity (e.g. voltage) of the elements. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and  whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code. The taxonomy for component of the power grid can thus be presented in the following manner: `PWG/ENERGYSOURCE/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS`, e.g.

Electric ditribution line through pylones: `PWG/SSM/ANC`

pipelines. Our classification is based on the HAZUS guidelines.

The alphanumeric taxonomy strings are:<br>
`PWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS` for potable water<br>
`WWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS` for wasterwater

### Communication systems

A communication system is comprised by offices dedicated to the reception and dissimination of information (e.g. telephones offices, call centers, TV stations, radio station, telecomunication stations), supporting transmitter towers and distribution circuits.  The components have been classified based on the classification system proposed by HAZUS. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code.

## Crops, Livestock and Forestry

The taxonomy for crops, livestock and forestry was defined based on existing classification systems supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). For crops, the classification system in the 2000 agricultural census programme was adopted. This system comprises a wide range of attributes such as growing cycle (temporary/permanent), crop species, crop variety, season, land type, amongst others. The taxonomy proposed herein uses the first and second categorization levels proposed by FAO, as well as the growing cycle (e.g. permanent or temporary). A simple alphanumeric code is attributed to each class of crop.

## Socio-Economic indicators

Natural hazards are a complex phenomenon featuring large number of interactions that result into loss of lives, livelihoods and interruption of systems. The socio-economic indicators are related to the capacity of populations to prepare, respond and recover from potential damage. For example, education theme is related to awareness, which is essential for a population to avoid and cope with a disaster. The Socio-economic Indicators taxonomy aims at identifying and describing a set of variables which provide a basis for understanding and measuring resilience, social vulnerability and economic vulnerability. The taxonomy system is divided into eight main themes (economy, education, environment, government and institutional capacity, index, health, infrastructure and population), each theme is later subdivided to different levels of detail. The eight main themes in the Socio-economic Indicator Taxonomy are the following:

- [Population](#population): defines community demographics: structure, distribution and size.
- [Economy](#economy): measures the welfare and social security levels of communities
- [Education](#education): provides information about invested resources and expected outcome of education, access and participation to education
- [Environment](#environment): defines the underlying conditions that make an environment susceptible to damage, disaster experience and prevalence
- [Governance and institutional capacity](#governance): institutional performance and regulatory efficiency, corruption control and stability of political system
- [Health](#health): population health conditions and health sector capabilities
- [Index](#index): range of indexes that cover different sectors, for example, the Disaster Risk Index used by the United Nation Development programme to monitor the global evolution of risk.
- [Infrastructure](#infrastructure): Transportation and communication infrastructure, status and access to utility lifelines
