# Core Standards

RDLS has been built based on existing open data standards.

In this section you will find a short summary of the core standards upon which the RDL data model has been built.


## General standards
RDLS is built using [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format which is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.


## Exposure standards
In 2018 an international consortium led by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation (GEM) developed an open, multi-scale exposure data schema for multi-hazard analysis (GED4ALL) in response to recommendations from community consultation. GED4ALL simplified certain detailed engineering aspects of the original global exposure model focussed on earthquake hazards ([GED4GEM](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8755293020919429)), while also expanding the exposure parameters included, so the impacts of other hazards could be related to exposure data using the standard.

Details about the development of GED4ALL are reported [here](https://riskdatalibrary.org/resources).


## Hazard data standards
In 2018 an international consortium led by the British Geological Survey developed a first-of-its-kind standard for hazard information.
Details about the development are reported [here](https://riskdatalibrary.org/resources).


## Vulnerability data standards
In 2018 an international consortium led by the UCL EPICentre developed a first-of-its-kind standard for vulnerability information, called MOVER.
Details about the development are reported [here](https://riskdatalibrary.org/resources).


## Loss data standards
In 2019 GEM and UCL EPICentre developed a first-of-its-kind standard for loss information.
Details about the development are reported [here](https://riskdatalibrary.org/resources).
