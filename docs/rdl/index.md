# Risk Data Library

Following [key concepts](../keyconcepts.md), the Risk Data Library Standard schema includes four components:

- [**Hazard**](hazard.md): main hazard type, specific process, trigger of the hazard, occurrence frequency of event, intensity unit to measure the process and analytical method.
- [**Exposure**](exposure.md): asset category, occupancy and specific taxonomy, cost type and value.
- [**Vulnerability**](vulnerability.md): model that links hazard intensity and exposure classification to measure of impact over the total exposed value.
- [**Loss**](loss.md): modelled damage and losses produced in a risk assessment as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability components.
