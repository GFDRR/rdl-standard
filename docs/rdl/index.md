# Overview

The Risk Data Library (RDL) project grew out of in-depth community consultation on improving access to **risk information**. 

The RDL Standard (RDLS) is a result of the collective effort and ongoing support of internationally-recognised research insitutions and established global partnerships with combined expertise across multiple hazards and all aspects of risk assessment. The partners have a complete understanding of the challenges risk analysts face in finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments, for various scales and contexts.

The RDLS gives risk experts a single language to describe hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets. It gives datasets an underlying consistency that makes them highly interoperable and easily read by both people and machines. The schema contains labels for key metadata fields, making it easier to identify datasets hosted in different online catalogs without relying on external files or descriptions.

Its overarching purpose is to support disaster resilience work by making risk data better and easier to work with.
