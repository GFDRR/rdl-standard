# Use cases

A **risk analyst** is scoping available risk data for a **disaster risk reduction project**. Searching the **RDL catalog** they can review the available data for the location of interest. They can then interrogate the data easily given the detailed and consistent **metadata** available, to make a decision on whether to directly use it in their analysis or invest in improving it.

  ***Value***: Reduced time to find and understand existing data.

A **development bank** produces public good dashboards to deliver **risk insights** to client governments. The dashboard uses risk data from multiple projects to estimate the **number of assets or population** exposed to risk to assist in prioritising investments. Pulling data via the **RDL API**, many different datasets can be ingested and applied through a single workflow.

  ***Value***: Efficient data pipelines to ingest multiple datasets with confidence in the consistency of data structure and metadata.

An **academic research team** needs to demonstrate the impact of a **risk analytics and urban planning project**, by making the data available for others to use. Their dataset are formatted according to the **RDL standards** and published in a data catalogue set up for the project, using the **template implementation** available through the RDL project.

  ***Value***: The pre-designed open-source deployable solutions can assist a research group achieve impact efficiently.

A **humanitarian organisation** are creating a **disaster risk financing** program to fund, ex-ante, disaster response and recovery and an **anticipatory action** program. They are relying on historical observations to assess the risk to define a suitable risk layered approach and select the correct DRF solutions, and want to improve this method by including probabilistic analysis. Using RDL tools they are able to find datasets and the results of previous risk analysis. Because the datasets are formatted according to the **RDL standards** they are able to quickly understand the contents of the data and whether it is suitable for their use. 

  ***Value***: The data can be improve existing methods in risk financing to make DRF solution more efficient and sustianable.
