# Adoption of RDL

The RDL schema and standard can be adopted to risk project data in different ways:

- [**Structure and naming convention**](local.md) of risk data files and folders
- [**Catalogue implementation**](jkan.md) based on open-source *JKAN* static content creator for simple file storage and download
- [**Database implementation**](postgres.md) based on *PostGRESQL* for advanced features
