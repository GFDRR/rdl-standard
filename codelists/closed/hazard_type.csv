UNDRRHazardCategory,Code,Title,Description
Meteorological and hydrological,coastal_flood,Coastal Flood,"Inundation of water from the sea into coastal areas, coastal flooding is most frequently the result of storm surges and high winds coinciding with high tides."
Meteorological and hydrological,convective_storm,Convective Storm,"Convective storms or thunderstorms, are severe local storms formed through the process of convection, whereby heat and moisture are transported vertically in the atmosphere. They are associated with thunder, lightning, heavy rain, hail, strong winds and sudden temperature changes. They can occur all year round but are most common during summer (RMETS, 2020)."
Meteorological and hydrological,drought,Drought,"A drought is a period of abnormally dry weather characterised by a prolonged deficiency of precipitation below a certain threshold over a large area and a period longer than a month (WMO, 2020)."
Meteorological and hydrological,extreme_temperature,Extreme Temperature,"Temperature extremes including extreme heat and cold, referred to as heat waves and cold waves."
Meteorological and hydrological,flood,Flood,"Inundation of water as a result of rainfall ponding on the surface and/or originating from river channels, includes pluvial flood and fluvial flood."
Meteorological and hydrological,WF,Wildfire,"Wildfires are any unplanned or uncontrolled fire affecting natural, cultural, industrial and residential landscapes (adapted from FAO, 2010)."
Meteorological and hydrological,WI,Strong Wind,"Storms in which high wind speeds and wind forces contribute to damage, including tropical storms and cyclone, extra-tropical cyclone, and tornado."
Geohazards,earthquake,Earthquake,"A sudden slip on a fault, and the resulting ground shaking and radiated seismic energy caused by the slip, volcanic or magmatic activity, or other sudden stress changes in the Earth (USGS, no date)."
Geohazards,LS,Landslide,"Landslide, or mass movement, is the downslope movement of soil, rock and organic materials under the effects of gravity. Includes various sub-types of landslide including rockfall and mudflows."
Geohazards,TS,Tsunami,"A tsunami is a series of travelling waves of extremely long length and period, usually generated by ground movement in earthquakes but also caused by landslides, volcanic eruption and meteorological pressure."
Geohazards,VO,Volcanic,"Volcanic hazard refers to any potentially dangerous volcanic process that puts human lives, livelihoods or infrastructure at risk of harm. Several hazards may affect the area around the volcano, such as lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars, j√∂kulhlaups and landslides or debris avalanches with tephra fall, including ashfall further afield (adapted from BGS, 2012)."
