In order to summarise all the asset information into a single alphanumeric string, a tool will be provided, similar to the 'taxtweb' tool available from GEM dedicated to buildings taxonomy. The taxonomy covers four main categories: Buildings Lifelines Crops, Livestock and Forestry Socio-Economic indicators Buildings The buildings taxonomy is based on GEM openquake taxonomy, with some semplifications. The taxonomy string is built as sequence of attributes separeted by slash: MATERIAL/HEIGHT/DATE/OCCUPANCY/SHAPE/\u2026 Missing attributes can be skipped from the string, e.g. 2-floors detached residential dwelling, reinforced concrete structure: CR/H:2/RES1 Attribute Code Description Material of the Lateral Load-Resisting System (LLRS) -- Unknown material C Concrete, unknown reinforcement CU Concrete, unreinforced * CR Concrete, reinforced SRC Concrete, composite with steel section S Steel ME Metal (except steel) M Masonry, unknown reinforcement MUR Masonry, unreinforced MCF Masonry, confined MR Masonry, reinforced E Earth, unknown reinforcement EU Earth, unreinforced ER Earth, reinforced W Wood MIX Mixed materials (hybrid or composite) INF Informal materials MATO Other material Height -- Number of storeys unknown H:n n is the exact number of storeys above ground HBET:a-b a-b is the range of number of storeys above ground (a=upper bound, and b= lower bound). a-b, range of number of storeys above HAPP:n HAPP:n, approximate number of storeys above ground.

Roads and railways This taxonomy is strongly based on the classification system adopted by OpenStreetMap, since OSM is undoubtedly the largest and most complete source of open information concerning the location of roads and railways. The taxonomy string is simply TYPE+CATEGORY , e.g. Secondary road: RDN+SE Attribute Code Description Road network RDN+MO Motorway: restricted access major divided highway (i.e. freeway), normally with 2 or more running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder RDN+TR Trunk: the most important roads in a country's system that aren't motorways (not necessarily be a divided highway) RDN+PR Primary: the next most important roads in a country's system (often link larger towns) RDN+SE Secondary: the next most important roads in a country's system (often link towns) RDN+TE Tertiary: the next most important roads in a country's system (often link smaller towns and villages) RDN+UN Unclassified: the least important through roads in a country's system (often link villages and hamlets) RDN+RE Residential: roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing. RDN+SR Service: access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. RDN Unknown: no information concerning road typology Railway network RLW+LR Light rail: a higher-standard tram system, normally in its own right-of-way. Often reaches a considerable length (tens of kilometer) RLW+MR Monorail: a single-rail railway RLW+RL Rail: full sized passenger or freight trains in the standard gauge for the country or state RLW+SW Subway: a city passenger underground rail service running mostly grade separated RLW+TR Tram: one or two carriage rail vehicles, usually sharing motor road. RLW Unknown: no additional information concerning rail typology. Pipelines The taxonomy presented herein has been developed using the classification experience developed in Syner-G and STREST (Crowley et al., 2016). The taxonomy string is simply PPL/CONTENT/POSITION/MATERIAL/JOINT_TYPE/SOIL_TYPE/DIAMETER , e.g. Large elevated pipe for potable water: CPW/PEL/DLG Attribute Code Description Content CGS Gas COL Oil CPW Potable water CWW Wastewater COT Other content -- Unknown Position PBU Buried PEL Elevated Material MPC Polyvinyl chloride MPE Polyethylene MCI Cast iron MDI Ductile iron MWS Welded steel MRM Reinforced plastic mortar MRM Resin transfer moulding MAC Asbestos-cement MC Concrete MCL Clay MO Other material MUB Unknown, brittle MUD Unknown, ductile -- Unknown material Joint type JAW Arc welded JGW Gas welded JCE Cemented JFW Fillet weld JBS Bell and spigot (caulked) JRI Riveted JMR Mechanical restrained JSC Screwed JRU Rubber gasket JSG Unknown, segmented JCO Unknown, continuous JO Other joint -- Unknown joint Soil type SCO Corrosive SNC Non corrosive -- Unknown soil type Diameter DSM Small (< 40 cm) DLG Large (\u2265 40 cm) -- Unknown diameter Energy generation and power grid We follow the taxonomy adopted by HAZUS, which allows capturing the capacity (e.g. voltage) of the elements. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code. The taxonomy for component of the power grid can thus be presented in the following manner: PWG/ENERGYSOURCE/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS , e.g. Electric ditribution line through pylones: PWG/SSM/ANC Attribute Code Description Energy Source OIL Oil GEO Geothermal NUC Nuclear HYD Hydroelectric WND Wind SOL Solar TDL Tidal wave GAS Gas BIO Biomass O Other -- Unknown Power Capacity PC: Value (integer) -- Unknown power capacity Power grid SSL Low Voltage (<115 KV) Substation SSM Medium Voltage (115-500 KV) Substation SSH High Voltage (>500 KV) Substation DTC Distribution circuit TMT Transmission tower Grid anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code C99 Code provisions unknown Potable water and wastewater systems Potable water systems are comprised by water treatment plants, storage tanks, pipelines and pumping stations, while wastewater systems are composed by wasterwater treatment plants, lifting stations and pipelines. Our classification is based on the HAZUS guidelines. The alphanumeric taxonomy strings are: PWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS for potable water WWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS for wasterwater Attribute Code Description Potable water PWR Component PWS Small potable water treatment plant (<50 MGD) PWM Medium potable water treatment plant (50-200 MGD) PWL Large potable water treatment plant (>200 MGD) PPS Small pumping plant (<10 MGD) PPM Medium pumping plant (10-50 MGD) PPL Large pumping plant (>50 MGD) Anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code -- Code provisions unknown Wastewater WWR Component WWS Small wastewater treatment plant (<50 MGD) WWM Medium wastewater treatment plant (50-200 MGD) WWL Large wastewater treatment plant (>200 MGD) LSS Small lift station (<10 MGD) LSM Medium lift station (10-50 MGD) LSL Large lift station (>50 MGD) Anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code -- Code provisions unknown Communication systems A communication system is comprised by offices dedicated to the reception and dissimination of information (e.g. telephones offices, call centers, TV stations, radio station, telecomunication stations), supporting transmitter towers and distribution circuits. The components have been classified based on the classification system proposed by HAZUS. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code. The taxonomy string for the components of a communication system is: COM/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE Attribute Code Description Component TRD AM or FM radio transmitters TTV TV stations or transmitters TWE Weather stations or transmitters TTT Telecommunication transmitters TOT Other stations or transmitters DTC Distribution circuit Anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code -- Code provisions unknown Crops, Livestock and Forestry The taxonomy for crops, livestock and forestry was defined based on existing classification systems supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). For crops, the classification system in the 2000 agricultural census programme was adopted. This system comprises a wide range of attributes such as growing cycle (temporary/permanent), crop species, crop variety, season, land type, amongst others. The taxonomy proposed herein uses the first and second categorization levels proposed by FAO, as well as the growing cycle (e.g. permanent or temporary). A simple alphanumeric code is attributed to each class of crop.

The socio-economic indicators are related to the capacity of populations to prepare, respond and recover from potential damage. For example, education theme is related to awareness, which is essential for a population to avoid and cope with a disaster. The Socio-economic Indicators taxonomy aims at identifying and describing a set of variables which provide a basis for understanding and measuring resilience, social vulnerability and economic vulnerability. The taxonomy system is divided into eight main themes (economy, education, environment, government and institutional capacity, index, health, infrastructure and population), each theme is later subdivided to different levels of detail. The eight main themes in the Socio-economic Indicator Taxonomy are the following: Population : defines community demographics: structure, distribution and size. Economy : measures the welfare and social security levels of communities Education : provides information about invested resources and expected outcome of education, access and participation to education Environment : defines the underlying conditions that make an environment susceptible to damage, disaster experience and prevalence Governance and institutional capacity : institutional performance and regulatory efficiency, corruption control and stability of political system Health : population health conditions and health sector capabilities Index : range of indexes that cover different sectors, for example, the Disaster Risk Index used by the United Nation Development programme to monitor the global evolution of risk. Infrastructure : Transportation and communication infrastructure, status and access to utility lifelines Population Attribute Code Description Population Structure POPPPSPOP Population POPPPSRPP Rural population POPPPSRUB Urbanization Rate POPPPSSRI Sex ratio POPPPSUPR Urban population POPPPSADP Age dependency ratio POPPPSAPD Average Population Density (areas over 400 ppl/km2) POPPPSCAO Percentage of land area with over 400 people per km2 POPPPSIMP Foreign Born Migrants POPPPSLPF Labour force participation rate -

The eight main themes in the Socio-economic Indicator Taxonomy are the following: Population : defines community demographics: structure, distribution and size. Economy : measures the welfare and social security levels of communities Education : provides information about invested resources and expected outcome of education, access and participation to education Environment : defines the underlying conditions that make an environment susceptible to damage, disaster experience and prevalence Governance and institutional capacity : institutional performance and regulatory efficiency, corruption control and stability of political system Health : population health conditions and health sector capabilities Index : range of indexes that cover different sectors, for example, the Disaster Risk Index used by the United Nation Development programme to monitor the global evolution of risk.

The standard aims to define a data model, taxonomies and additional specifications to improve the discovery, management and exchange of risk data. This document is intended to be a useful reference point for anyone involved in contributing to the standard. It focuses on the roles, responsibilities and processes. This is intended to complete the contributor guide which outlines the range of ways in which contributors might support development of the standard. Our governance principles As a group we are committed to the OpenStand principles . These are five principles that guide our work: Due process . Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants. No one party dominates or guides standards development. Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions. Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined. Broad consensus . Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range of interests. Transparency . Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation. Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided. Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption. Balance . Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group. Openness . Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties. We are working to improve our process to ensure that we are living up to these principles. This document provides a reference point for our current practices. Intellectual property All the outputs from this standards initiative are openly licensed under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence. Additional documentation and source code produced by this initiative will also be published under a suitable open licence. We encourage other organisations to similarly licence their work, so that it can be used for the benefit of the wider community. Roles and responsibilities This project is currently managed by the Risk Data Library team working within the Global Facility for Disaster Risk and Reduction . To guide development and adoption of the standards, in addition to open working through this github project, the team invites expert input via an Advisory Group and, as required, specific Technical Working Groups. Advisory Group The RDL Advisory Group consists of experts in risk data management and analysis from the humanitarian sector, insurance industry and other related domains. The Advisory Group will help to: ensure the development of the standard is informed by the needs of a broad selection of stakeholders across a range of domains steer the development of the RDL standards, providing expert review on priorities, activities and major technical decisions. ensure that our work aligns with other relevant initiatives, to avoid duplication of work and to build momentum around adoption of common standards identify opportunities for joint projects that can demonstrate the value of adopting the RDL standards disseminate the impacts and outputs of the RDL project to other stakeholders Participation in the Advisory Group is by invitation only. The initial membership will consist of representatives from organisations who have contributed to the early development of the standard. Membership will be regularly reviewed. Please contact the team to discuss participation if you believe that you, or your organisation, are able to contribute. The Advisory Group will meet every two months. The agenda, slides and minutes from these meetings will be publicly shared via this Github forum. Technical Working Groups At times we may create specific Technical Working Groups that will collaborate on development of specific aspects of the RDL standard. For example to develop taxonomies, or revise file formats or schemas. These Working Groups will have a clear remit and will coordinate their work through this github. Membership of these groups and participation in calls and workshops will be open to all participants. Depending on the scope of work, they may need to draw on expertise from a wider group of stakeholders. This model reflects the process of development of early versions of the standard, which involves convening a range of organisations around developing models for hazard, exposure and other types of data. This approach will help us to drawing on expertise, and seek focused input, from across a wide range of organisations. All working documents, issue reporting and decisions made within these groups will be reviewed and communicated via this repository. How we collaborate At present our primary means of collaborating on the standard is via a set of open processes coordinated through this Github repository. We will use the: Discussions for general discussion around the scope and adoption of the standard Issues to propose and discuss changes to the standard Project boards to provide transparency of the current progress and priorities around its development Managing and proposing changes Anyone can propose changes to the specifications. The process for doing this is by submitting an issue using the appropriate template. We ask that you provide sufficient context to the proposed changes so that it can be discussed and reviewed by others. We will then: regularly review issues, to ensure they are in scope for the project encourage disussion and feedback, by requesting people leave comments on Github once we feel that a broad consensus has been achieved around the proposed changes, we will update the current Working Draft with suitable wording after leaving appropriate time for further comment, we will release a new version of the specification Managing releases The frequency with which we will release specifications will depend on the type and number of proposed changes. Releases of the standard will follow the semantic versioning conventions: Major releases will be used for major extensions to the model and/or to incorporate incompatible changes Minor releases will be used for backwards compatible changes, e.g. additional of new optional attributes and relationships, or for simple clarifications and corrections To support gradual migration to the latest specification, we will maintain historical versions of the specifications in named folders in this repository.","title":"Governance"},{"location":"governance.html#risk-data-library-standard-governance","text":"This document provides an overview of the governance and processes used to develop the Risk Data Library Standard.

For example, an observed flood event that occurred from 1.10.2009 (time start) to 3.10.2009 (time end), spanning over 3 days (time span). When precise time collocation is unknow or inapplicabile, a general reference date such as \"2009\" is used to identify events (time year).

The most common way to communicate this is the \"return period\", expressed as the number of years after which a given hazard intensity could occurr again: RP 100 indicates that that event has a probability of once in 100 years. This attirbute can indicate individual layer frequency (RP100) or a range of frequencies for a collection of layers (RP10-100) The probability of occurrence is usually calculated on the basis of a reference period that provides observations: this period can be specified by start date, end date and time span.

Main definitions are taken from the UNDRR Terminology . Disaster risk Disaster risk is the potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed or damaged assets which could occur to a system, society or a community in a specific period of time, determined probabilistically as a function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity. Disaster risk comprises different types of potential impacts and losses (direct and indirect, tangible and intangible) which are sometimes difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, with knowledge of the prevailing hazards, the patterns of population and socio-economic development and their tendency to suffer impacts, disaster risks can be assessed and mapped, at least in broad terms. Source: Disaster Risk, UNDRR Terminology Disaster risk management Disaster risk management is the application of disaster risk reduction policies and strategies to prevent new disaster risk, reduce existing disaster risk and manage residual risk, contributing to the strengthening of resilience and reduction of disaster losses. Source: Disaster Risk Management, UNDRR Terminology Disaster risk assessment A qualitative or quantitative approach to determine the nature and extent of disaster risk by analysing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of exposure and vulnerability that together could harm people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend. Source: Disaster Risk Assessment, UNDRR Terminology Disaster risk information (risk data) Comprehensive information on all dimensions of disaster risk, including hazards, exposure, vulnerability and capacity, related to persons, communities, organizations and countries and their assets. Disaster risk information also includes the results of disaster risk assessments often expressed in terms of potential losses or impacts. Source: Disaster Risk Information, UNDRR Terminology Hazard An hazard is a process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. Hazards may be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. Each hazard is characterized by its location, intensity or magnitude, frequency and probability. An hazardous event is the manifestation of a hazard in a particular place during a particular period of time. Hazards can have natural or anthropogenic origin. Natural hazards are associated with natural processes and phenomena (geological, geophysical and hydrometeorological). Source: Source: Hazard, UNDRR Terminology Exposure The situation of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas. Measures of exposure can include the number of people or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks associated with that hazard in the area of interest Source: Exposure, UNDRR Terminology Vulnerability Vulnerability are the conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or systems to the impacts of hazards. The inverse of vulnerability is defined coping capacity, which is the combination of all the strengths, attributes and resources available within an organization, community or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience. Source: Vulnerability, UNDRR Terminology Cat model Catastrophe risk models (cat models) are common tools used to assess natural disaster risk. The models typically have four components: hazard, exposure, vulnerability and loss. A subset of a catastrophe risk model is an impact model, which is essentially a risk model that can only be used deterministically. The impact model uses hypothetical or historical events to simulate \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios that are often used as an aid for disaster planning and management. An example of an impact modeling tool is InaSAFE.

A wide range of model types and parameters can describe vulnerability, for this reason there are many possible variables accounted by the Vulnerability schema. But only a part of them will be required to describe one specific model. The schema distinguishes key information describing the vulnerabilirt model, including: function type (i.e fragility, vulnerability, damage-to-loss) countries the function was developed for, measured in terms of to geographic relevance development approach (empirical, analytical, judgement, hybrid, code-based) mathematical model used (including exponential, cumulative lognormal/normal) the intensity measure and asset type the function relates to loss parameter / engineering demand parameter values classDiagram Model -- Specifics Model -- Additional Model: Hazard type Model: Exposure taxonomy Model: Calculation method class Specifics{ Parameters Damage states Intensity measure } class Additional{ Validation Error Fitness } The model attributes specify which hazard types and exposure categories the vulnerability relationship applies to.
