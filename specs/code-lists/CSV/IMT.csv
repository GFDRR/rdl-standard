ASI_%,Agricultural Stress Index,"The Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) is a quick-look indicator that facilitates the early identification of cropped land with a high likelihood of water stress (drought). The Index is based on the integration of the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) in two dimensions that are critical in the assessment of a drought event in agriculture: temporal and spatial. Source: FAO Seasonal Global Indicators."
DI_-,Drought Intensity,"Agricultural droughts are classified by their intensity and are categorized into four classes: Extreme, Severe, Moderate or Mild. The intensity of the drought is calculated through the Weighted Mean Vegetation Health Index aggregated per GAUL 2 region. Source: FAO Seasonal Global Indicators."
WMVHI_-,Weighted Mean Vegetation Health Index,"The Weighted Mean Vegetation Health Index (Weighted Mean VHI) allows the user to assess the severity of the drought from the start of the growing season, examining the vegetation health and the influence of temperature on plant conditions. Source: FAO Seasonal Global Indicators."
NDVI_-,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,"The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measures the “greenness” of ground cover and is used as a proxy to indicate the density and health of vegetation. NDVI values range from +1 to -1, with high positive values corresponding to dense and healthy vegetation, and low and/or negative NDVI values indicating poor vegetation conditions or sparse vegetative cover. The NDVI anomaly indicates the variation of the current dekad to the long-term average. Source: FAO Global Indicators."
VCI_-,Vegetation Condition Index,"The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI; 0-1) evaluates the current vegetation health in comparison to the historical trends. The VCI relates current dekadal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to its long-term minimum and maximum, normalized by the historical range of NDVI values for the same dekad. The VCI was designed to separate the weather-related component of the NDVI from the ecological element. Source: FAO Global Indicators."
VHI_-,Vegetation Health Index,"The Vegetation Health Index (VHI; 0-1) illustrates the severity of drought based on the vegetation health and the influence of temperature on plant conditions. The VHI is a composite index and the elementary indicator used to compute the ASI. It combines both the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI). Source: FAO Global Indicators."
CMI_-,Crop Moisture Index,"The CMI (Eight classes from "Severely Dry" to "Excessively Wet") gives the short-term or current status of purely agricultural drought or moisture surplus and can change rapidly from week to week.

SPI_-,Standard Precipitation Index,"The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a widely used index to characterize meteorological drought on a range of timescales. On short timescales, the SPI is closely related to soil moisture, while at longer timescales, the SPI can be related to groundwater and reservoir storage.

SPEI_-,Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index,"The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is an extension of the widely used Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPEI is designed to take into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) in determining drought.

WBGT_c,Wet Bulb Globe Temperature in Celsius,"The WetBulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is a measure of the heat stress in direct sunlight, which takes into account: temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover (solar radiation). This differs from the heat index, which takes into consideration temperature and humidity and is calculated for shady areas. Source: https://www.weather.gov/tsa/wbgt."
FWI_-,Fire Weather Index,"The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a meteorologically based dimensionless index used worldwide to estimate fire danger. It consists of different components that account for the effects of fuel moisture and wind on fire behaviour and spread. The higher the FWI is, the more favourable the meteorological conditions to trigger a wildfire."
