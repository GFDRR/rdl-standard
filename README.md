# Risk Data Library Standard

The Risk Data Library Standard is a data model for describing Hazard, Exposure, 
Vulnerability and Loss data.

The model describes the common core metadata that applies to all risk datasets, 
as well as standardised metadata that applies to Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability and Loss 
data.

This repository is used to coordinate the development of this data model. It will 
be used to:

* publish working and released drafts of the data model specifications
* coordinate collaboration and discussion around the iterative development of those specifications
* provide an overview of the current status and roadmap

## Intended audience

The repository is intended to support the work of those developing and contributing to the 
Risk Data Library specifications.

This repository is intended to:

* support comments or feedback on the current specifications
* propose and discuss changes, e.g. in the form of revised wording or additions to the model
* answer questions about the governance and evolution of the standard

of [the Risk Data Library project](http://riskdatalibrary.org/), or are looking for a more [high-level introduction to 
the standard and its key concepts](https://docs.riskdatalibrary.org/).
