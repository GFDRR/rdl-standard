In addition to providing hazard maps and assessing risks, Aqueduct Floods enables its users to conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the value of dike flood protection strategies.",

It provides flood water extent and depth for a range of pluvial and fluvial hazard scenarios, expressed as “return period”, which indicates the probability of occurrence (i.e. once in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 years). The Data are at 1 km resolution and have a global coverage.",
