Title,Aqueduct Floods Hazard Maps
Description,"Aqueduct Floods is an online platform that measures riverine and coastal flood risks under both current baseline conditions and future projections in 2030, 2050, an 2080. In addition to providing hazard maps and assessing risks, Aqueduct Floods enables its users to conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the value of dike flood protection strategies."

Dataset version,2020
Project title,Aqueduct
Additional details,"The Aqueduct flood-hazard model is a global gridded dataset of flood hazard produced at the global scale. It provides flood water extent and depth for a range of pluvial and fluvial hazard scenarios, expressed as “return period”, which indicates the probability of occurrence (i.e. once in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 years). The Data are at 1 km resolution and have a global coverage."
