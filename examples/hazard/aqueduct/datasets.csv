Additional details,"The Aqueduct flood-hazard model is a global gridded dataset of flood hazard produced at the global scale. It provides flood water extent and depth for a range of pluvial and fluvial hazard scenarios, expressed as “return period”, which indicates the probability of occurrence (i.e. once in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 years). The Data are at 1 km resolution and have a global coverage."
