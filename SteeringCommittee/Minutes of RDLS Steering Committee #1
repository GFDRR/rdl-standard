## Notes
-	Discussion referred to background notes circulated prior to the meeting
-	Slides used
-	Introductions to whole committee 
-	Presentation of background / history of RDLS, followed by roadmap, current implementations, SwissRe Foundation interest in funding this project  - see slides
-	Data is available openly as well as tools - WB DDH is principle distribution of data of WB data.
-	Discussion of PROPOSED Governance of RDLS (also see slides)
-	Steering committee role is to act as a working group with practical inputs.
-	Governance has been proposed with Standards expert (Leigh Dodds, formerly Open Data Institute; acting as consultant to RDL project)
-	Minutes of SC to be agreed with SC members before making public.
-	Proposal made to redact certain information e.g., joint proposals in preparation, private data, unpublished work, etc. Agreed. 
-	Closed notes from meetings; discussions on standard developments, feedback on standard should be made public.
-	Meeting frequency of every two months - Agreed as suitable.
-	Proposal to include someone from model building community in the SC. Suggestions include Katrisk, JBA.
-	Clarification on curation: GFDRR will curate beyond the end of this Swiss Re Foundation funded project - GFDRR as ‘process owner’ but this is a digital public good, with development led by GFDRR. 
-	Clarified that this Fellowship project is funded by Swiss Re Foundation, but longer term sits under Digital Earth program of GFDRR. Long-term funding not secure. 
-	Discussion that it would make sense that WB should hire someone to work on this as WB benefits ultimately but doesn’t fund RDLS directly. Funded by donors to date. Objective should be to make the case that it needs to be financed in long-term manner.  
-	Achieving this should influence project design - who should be involved, what impact to show, which sectors most likely to use it. Can promote it under DEP, encourage compliance with RDLS (in WB project, example of WB money contributing to open data).
-	IP: The standard is currently openly licensed CC-BY-SA-4.0. (not necessarily data)
-	Confirmed that private entity could integrate the solution into their workflow and write in data using RDLS format/schema. They would be encouraged (not obliged) to contribute their improvements to the RDLS. 
-	Maintain control over closed source development projects. Do not close the door to this, but make sure we can handle these requests. 
-	ODS is CC-01 - completely open (do have people developing and not contributing back).
-	GEM use CC-BY-SA for data. SA is the most crucial part. Sometimes add NC where using commercial data. Software: GPL. Add terms of use. Invite anyone working on changes to the standard to contact us - avoid generating incompatibility. Communciation of the licence is key.
-	Current licence can be reviewed for suitability.
-	How we collaborate
-	Agreed Github can be used - issues, project discussions and data pipelines
-	Data stored primarily on WB DDH (data with relevance to WB projects)
-	SC commitment
-	Paul Henshaw and Matt Donovan Members present agreed to sit on SC. Nick Moody and Tiziana Rossetto were not present for this part of the discussion.
-	Potential Fellowhip locations discussed: GEM have active Malawi WB project active for WB, done lots in Tanzania previousy.
-	Swiss Re Foundation expectation: how we can bring RDL/OED closer together / how to bring insurance risk assessment angle to RDL - especially on exposure side (wrt different understanding of what exposure means - input as insurance industry, but part of the model for dev sector projects).
-	Proposed to present on links between PDS/RDLS - though IDF is working on these links, not main topic of Fellowship program but let's see how Fellows can contribute to this.
-	Subsequent meetings: Swiss Re Foundation want to hear from other grantees, other presenters from NGO sector etc on what they’re doing on data standards too.
