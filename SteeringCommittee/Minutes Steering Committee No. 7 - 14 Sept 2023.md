## Notes

**Updates to documentation and request for any feedback as you review (Stuart)**
- Request for data documentation: PH: MWI data not his, but checking. GEM data is in the Db format - knew data  commonly used by GEM would fit, but interested to see others - agriculture, etc. Suggest to make use of other data - interoperability of data where data is used by others, or produced by others - the value for GEM is not the use of RDLS internally - already document their data in internal formats. 
PC: We should communicate on GEM involvement in RDL project - how to keep up on their progress, and how pushing for adoption / adopting the standard. 
- NM: Value is clear but what are forces and barriers to adoption. Is adoption clear in WB, or limited to GFDRR currently? PC: Strategy in WB is to go by different sectors, projects first - framework contract for risk assessment - pre-selected set of firms. TOR requests use of RDLS when sharing outputs.
- SF: how can we promote adoption in organisations. SH: TOR are a stick to drive takeup, but support from the RDL that eases the process would be v helpful.  PH: Convertors are helpful. Oasis convertors would be helpful. Possible for exposure. More diff for Vuln. Talking about data. HP: modular is nice, each category is clear. IFRC - our data might be able to be converted into format but in some cases it can’t - loss&damage not in the same language. Specific contexts where its 1:1 from differetn standards, examples where there are exceptions where the standard may not align. SF: follow up on examples of misalignment with IFRC.
- PC: tooling component - SC could look at what is needed for development and adoption

**Tools – Availability and use of the metadata creation and validation tool (Jen)**.
- JH: convertor demo. Highlighting errors, link to share metadata for 7 days. 
- SH: can we capture (download the errors) 
- JC: does the json file get generated with errors? - JH: - yes, with errors contained
- PH: Additional fields added? - JH: Will be added in JSON - present in the object/sheet where you added it in spreadsheet. PH: Is this what we want? Action - consider how to treat add. Fields
- CH: what is ultimate output - for NGOs, etc? Not the tool and validation of data. PC/SF: different levels of outputs - convertor tool is to help technical level of adoption. We will produce videos to promote at higher level - how the RDLS benefits operational projects e.g. on RDLS maximising impact of data generated [this is also the carrot for WB TTLs during internal meetings].

**Fellowship updates**
- AG: Have held several Fellow workshops including SF/MA / HP and own fellows, highlighting Zia and Isa project work. Will be promoting RDLS at Colombia Uni conference, and in WB - and during a week of WB meetings in DC. PC: Dedicated workshop at WB HQ - November 14th. To incl data sprint, in full week of activities.

**Communications plan**
- From Oct 2nd (see presentation for full schedule)
- Request for any specific work done with RDLS to go into blog of organizations in first week of Oct.
- Invitation to present at the external webinar on work done. 
- Video tutorials and high-level comms video
- Stakeholder mapping - need to add names, and create links with orgs. 
- HP: Links with HDX - could create a bolt-on, ‘would you like to convert your data into RDLS’? - could be a driver of adoption.
- PC - yes - could provide a way to access exposure information. SF: Would want them to host RLDS metadata as first step
- HP: agrees but lots of data types on there - may throw up areas of misalignment.
- NM: Mapaction has a data scientist embedded in HDX - possible useful linkage?
- CH: Would repost if SRF are tagged, wouldn’t have something on their website.
  - Blog needs to promote benefits to end users - make it less WB focussed. How can each stakeholder use it.
  - External webinars - already in 4 weeks - who is doing invitations
  - Need to clarify more for Carolina
  - Oct 10th is Swiss holiday
  - Do we need different webinars for different audiences? Tech and high level 
- PH: really useful to highlight different use cases with different messages. Should be clear that RDLS is bringing advantage to these communities.


 **AOB**  

  ## Actions:  
- Document what happens with additional fields
- Set up call with HDX
- Set up call with IFRC - loss and damage focus.
- Add high level video production into comms plan. Focus on communicating the benefits to sectors to drive adoption, not tools/validation level technical information.

  ## Proposed agenda to include:  
- Final planned SC meeting under Swiss Re Foundation funding
- Communications, take-up activities since September
- Plan for further SC involvement
