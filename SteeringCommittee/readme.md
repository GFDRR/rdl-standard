The RDL Steering Committee consists of experts in risk data management and analysis from the humanitarian sector, insurance industry and other related domains.

The Steering Committee will help to:
- ensure the development of the standard is informed by the needs of a broad selection of stakeholders across a range of domains
- steer the development of the RDL standards, providing expert review on priorities, activities and major technical decisions.
- ensure that our work aligns with other relevant initiatives, to avoid duplication of work and to build momentum around adoption of common standards
- identify opportunities for joint projects that can demonstrate the value of adopting the RDL standards
- disseminate the impacts and outputs of the RDL project to other stakeholders

Participation in the Steering Committee is by invitation only. The initial membership will consist of representatives from organisations who have contributed to the early development of the standard.
Membership will be regularly reviewed. Please contact the team to discuss participation if you believe that you, or your organisation, are able to contribute.

The Steering Committee will meet every two months. The agenda, slides and minutes from these meetings will be publicly shared through this GitHub repository.

When taking minutes, we recommend using Markdown editor https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/
