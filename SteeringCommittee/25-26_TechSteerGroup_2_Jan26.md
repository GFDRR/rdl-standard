## Notes
- JKAN and MDE demo
  - Added dataset, now 134
  - Features, request for feedback by end of Jan.
- Pipeline update - stu to make sure Scott doesn't request from JBA; Stu to send Tom relevant links.
- Development - ODS timeline, send a summary of changes and where we would like inputs form the group.
- RDL Fellows: identifying data scientists in WB client countries - greater spread of inputs and users
  - FCV countries
  - 9 in S-S Africa, one FCV-Nexus program (global)
  - Timeline - KO 14 Jan. Snapshot of projects: country, focus, TTLs. Urban focus consistently
  - FCV Scan - make it use RDLS metadata.
  - JBA - a few countries JBA are active in.
  - Tom: PHD student from South Sudan - connect with fellow. Wider program FCDO supported, overlap with Fellow countries.
- Bonn Technical Forum
  - Regional Pathways for integrated
  - Officially released DELTA - live demos - ingest of data. Audience is mix of policy and technical
  - Technical questions on standards:
    - Hazards and assets. Some heated discussions. Will follow HIPS for hazards
    - Asset - giving as much flexibility to users, asset categories from PDNAs.
    - Pushing to have something more standardised, UN preferring flexibility.
  - Event after - Brussels - Christos went - common meeting of DPEG - disaster prev and risk mment group
    - DGs ECHO, ECFIN: European / national loss database; value of connected data.
    - Harmonization of data between the systems. Positive: country reps understood the message/value
    - Need to see how practically implemented.

     **(Sam - please confirm OK to include this image in notes)**

    - IFRC GO: taxonomy they're using (GLIDE), EM-DAT classification tree. Luke Caley.
  - Overture foundation - also in tough with JRC? PC: interesting approach.
    - making sure standards can come to each other through different IDs.
    - WB might be working more with them.


## Discussion
-	Region grouping on JKAN? - possible - need to decide on a grouping to use - not WB.
-	Ric: semantic search is interesting; looking at datasets as well. Useful to have a map search additional to semantic search
- Map function possible: priority is getting lots of data on it, hence lightweight. Not seeking to replicate very nice geoportals.

   
## Actions:  
- Rachel, Tom, Ric, James (and/or colleagues) to provide feedback by end Jan on JKAN functions/features as they are now (requests for map/region search already noted)
- Stu to remind for feedback by end Jan
- Stu to make sure Scott doesn't request from JBA.
- Stu to send Tom relevant links for data review.
- Mat / Stu to send a summary of pertinent changes.
- Pierre to share what he can on RDL Fellow / projects
- Stu to report back on DELTA / RDLS supporting loss catalogues at next SC.
